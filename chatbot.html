Learners MUST make their own notes derived from activities and discussions.

Observe initial reactions.\n        - Learners' Activity (Discovery): Actively participate, recall, observe/interact with stimulus, discuss, formulate initial questions.\n    - 'Explore' Phase (Discovery, Investigation, Analysis):\n        - Teacher's Activity (OCP): Facilitate learner investigation/exploration, provide specific resources/materials, guide group work effectively, pose probing questions (Conversation), observe processes (Observation).\n        - Learners' Activity (Discovery, Analysis): Actively investigate the problem/question. Engage in hands-on activities, practicals (for 'S'-level LOs), experiments, or explore stimulus materials in depth. Collect data, make observations, discuss findings and ideas in pairs/groups, analyze information, and look for patterns. Learners should be making their own notes/records of their exploration.\n    - 'Explain' Phase (Learner Articulation & Concept Formalization):\n        - Teacher's Activity (OCP): Guide learners to share and articulate their findings, explanations, and solutions derived from the 'Explore' phase. Facilitate whole-class discussion (Conversation), clarify misconceptions, introduce formal terms AFTER exploration, guide note structuring, assess understanding through questions and learner explanations (Product, Conversation).\n        - Learners' Activity (Explanation, Analysis): Present their findings/explanations to peers or the class. Articulate concepts in their own words. Listen to and critique explanations from other groups/individuals. Refine their understanding based on discussion and teacher input. Organize and make their own comprehensive notes, summarizing key concepts and their discoveries.\n    - 'Elaborate' Phase (Application, Extension, Practice):\n        - Teacher's Activity (OCP): Provide opportunities for learners to apply their new understanding in different contexts or to solve new (but related) problems. This could involve new scenarios, case studies, further investigation, or project-based tasks. Challenge learners to extend their thinking.\n        - Learners' Activity (Application): Apply learned concepts and skills to new, varied, or more complex situations (aligning with Medium/High demand LOs). Work on tasks that require transfer of learning. May involve further research, design, creation, or presenting solutions to real-world analogous problems. Consolidate notes.\n    - 'Evaluate' Phase (Assessment for Learning):\n        - Teacher's Activity (OCP): Use formative assessment techniques to gauge learner understanding and competence acquisition. This includes observing learner participation and product, asking targeted questions, and reviewing learner-generated work (notes, reports, presentations, solutions). Provide timely and constructive feedback to learners.\n        - Learners' Activity: Demonstrate their understanding and skills through a specific task, presentation, or product. Engage in self-assessment or peer-assessment activities. Reflect on their learning journey and identify areas of strength and areas for improvement. Ask clarifying questions about their learning.\n    - 'Indicators of Learning/Assessment' Column:\n        - For each phase, list specific, observable learner behaviors, statements, written work, or products (aligning with OCP) that evidence learning and competence development for the LO (including its full syllabus reference and KUSVA).

(u, s)' implies medium/high demand, activities focusing on understanding and skills).\n        - Low demand LOs (often 'K' focused) might involve guided discovery of facts and teacher-facilitated questioning to build foundational knowledge, with learners actively summarizing or making notes.\n        - Medium/High demand LOs (often 'U' or 'S' focused) MUST emphasize learner-led exploration, analysis, application, problem-solving, practicals, projects, evaluation, or creation, with the teacher facilitating.\n        - Ensure a constructivist approach: learners actively construct knowledge. Learners MUST make their own notes derived from activities and discussions. Minimize direct note-giving by the teacher, especially for medium/high demand LOs.\n        - Consider Problem-Based Learning (PBL) elements where appropriate, such as introducing a Driving Question in 'Engage' or structuring 'Explore' around a problem.\n    - 'Teacher's Activity' Column (OCP Focus - Observation, Conversation, Product):\n        - Detail teacher actions focusing on facilitating learning, not lecturing (target <30% teacher talk time).

Observe initial reactions.\n        - Learners' Activity (Discovery): Actively participate, recall, observe/interact with stimulus, discuss, formulate initial questions.\n    - 'Explore' Phase (Discovery, Investigation, Analysis):\n        - Teacher's Activity (OCP): Facilitate learner investigation/exploration, provide specific resources/materials, guide group work effectively, pose probing questions (Conversation), observe processes (Observation).\n        - Learners' Activity (Discovery, Analysis): Actively investigate the problem/question. Engage in hands-on activities, practicals (for 'S'-level LOs), experiments, or explore stimulus materials in depth. Collect data, make observations, discuss findings and ideas in pairs/groups, analyze information, and look for patterns. Learners should be making their own notes/records of their exploration.\n    - 'Explain' Phase (Learner Articulation & Concept Formalization):\n        - Teacher's Activity (OCP): Guide learners to share and articulate their findings, explanations, and solutions derived from the 'Explore' phase. Facilitate whole-class discussion (Conversation), clarify misconceptions, introduce formal terms AFTER exploration, guide note structuring, assess understanding through questions and learner explanations (Product, Conversation).\n        - Learners' Activity (Explanation, Analysis): Present their findings/explanations to peers or the class. Articulate concepts in their own words. Listen to and critique explanations from other groups/individuals. Refine their understanding based on discussion and teacher input. Organize and make their own comprehensive notes, summarizing key concepts and their discoveries.\n    - 'Elaborate' Phase (Application, Extension, Practice):\n        - Teacher's Activity (OCP): Provide opportunities for learners to apply their new understanding in different contexts or to solve new (but related) problems. This could involve new scenarios, case studies, further investigation, or project-based tasks. Challenge learners to extend their thinking.\n        - Learners' Activity (Application): Apply learned concepts and skills to new, varied, or more complex situations (aligning with Medium/High demand LOs). Work on tasks that require transfer of learning. May involve further research, design, creation, or presenting solutions to real-world analogous problems. Consolidate notes.\n    - 'Evaluate' Phase (Assessment for Learning):\n        - Teacher's Activity (OCP): Use formative assessment techniques to gauge learner understanding and competence acquisition. This includes observing learner participation and product, asking targeted questions, and reviewing learner-generated work (notes, reports, presentations, solutions). Provide timely and constructive feedback to learners.\n        - Learners' Activity: Demonstrate their understanding and skills through a specific task, presentation, or product. Engage in self-assessment or peer-assessment activities. Reflect on their learning journey and identify areas of strength and areas for improvement. Ask clarifying questions about their learning.\n    - 'Indicators of Learning/Assessment' Column:\n        - For each phase, list specific, observable learner behaviors, statements, written work, or products (aligning with OCP) that evidence learning and competence development for the LO (including its full syllabus reference and KUSVA).
