üîß Technical Architecture

This application uses a modern, secure client-server architecture to protect the proprietary prompts and ensure a smooth user experience.

Frontend (Client-Side):

Built with React and styled with Tailwind CSS.

Contained within a single, clean index.html file.

Hosted on Netlify for fast, global delivery.

The frontend is "dumb" ‚Äî it contains no prompt logic. It dynamically fetches the list of available assistants and their corresponding prompts from the backend.

Backend (Server-Side):

Powered by Google Apps Script (GAS), deployed as a Web App.

Acts as a secure API endpoint.

Stores and manages all confidential AI prompts.

Handles all communication with the various third-party AI APIs (Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.).
